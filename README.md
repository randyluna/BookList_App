Below are just some notes for me that I was writing down throughout the code along. 



What I learned in this code along is that capitalization can impact your code significantly. 

Tags in HTML are special instructions closed in angle brackets <>
Open and closing tags are also referred to as the On and Off tags. <opening tag> ...<closing tag>
<Div< is used to group content so it can be easily styled.

mt-1 and so forth gives space..
